    "This practical application compares the performance of several classification models—Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines—using a real-world dataset from a Portuguese bank’s telephone-based marketing campaigns. The objective is to evaluate how effectively each model predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, while considering both predictive performance and computational cost.\n",

    "## Problem 11: Improving the Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that our models have been trained and evaluated, there are clear opportunities to further improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "All models used in this project include hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve generalization. Rather than relying on default values, techniques such as **grid search** and **cross-validation** can be used to systematically explore better configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "- **KNN**: tuning the number of neighbors (`n_neighbors`)\n",
    "- **Decision Trees**: controlling model complexity using parameters such as `max_depth`\n",
    "- **SVM**: adjusting the regularization parameter `C` and kernel-specific settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Careful tuning of these parameters can help reduce overfitting and improve performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjusting the Performance Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Although accuracy provides a useful baseline, it may not fully capture model performance due to class imbalance in the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional metrics such as **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC AUC** would provide a more complete and business-relevant evaluation, particularly when the cost of different types of prediction errors is not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Future improvements would focus on hyperparameter tuning and evaluating models using alternative performance metrics. These steps would help refine model selection and better align predictions with the business objective of improving marketing efficiency."
